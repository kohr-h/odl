ODL tutorial
############

Welcome to the ODL tutorial. Here, you will learn how to use ODL from the bottom up. The first
section of examples takes you through simple use cases and should make you familiar with the syntax
and the "feel" of working with the framework. In the second section, we go through more specific use
cases by introducing the main concepts. In the third section, we finally put all pieces together and
look at concrete problems in inverse problems. (TODO: a bit more details)

How to use the tutorial
=======================
Each tutorial is provided in two flavors - you can choose which one to use:

Option 1: `Jupyter Notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`_ (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A notebook is a structured file containing both static text (explanations, formulas, ...) and
interactive content. The big advantages of this format are that

- example code and accompanying text are kept together nicely,
- there is no need to switch to and from code and
- the code actually runs and can be changed at will.

This approach creates a very direct user experience and makes it easy to play around with or
extend existing examples.

For instruction on the installation of the Jupyter software, see the section "Jupyter Notebook" in
the :ref:`installation instructions <installing>`.
   
**Usage:** 

- Download the notebook file.
- Run ``jupyter notebook /path/to/notebook-file.ipynb``

This will open a browser tab with the notebook ready to be run. Click on
"Help -> User Interface Tour" for an introduction into Jupyter - it's really easy!


Option 2: Static HTML + Code file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The same Jupyter notebook as in option 1 is delivered as static web page using the 
`Notebook viewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`_, and the Python code is provided in a separate
file. You can run (parts of) the code in a Python console of your choice and read the tutorial
separately. This variant requires you to switch back and forth between code and accompanying text,
but it doesn't require a Jupyter installation on your computer.
