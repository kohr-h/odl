"""Examples of using the ufunc (Universal Function) functionals in ODL.

Here we demonstrate how the functionals can be composed with other operators
and functionals in order to achieve more complicated functions.

We create the L2-norm squared in two ways, first using the built in
L2NormSquared functional, and also by composing the square ufunc with the
L2Norm functional.
