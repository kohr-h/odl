"""L1-regularized denoising using the proximal gradient solvers.

Solves the optimization problem

    min_x  lam || T(W.inverse(x)) - g ||_2^2 + lam * || x ||_1

Where ``W`` is a wavelet operator, ``T`` is a parallel beam ray transform and
 ``g`` is given noisy data.

The proximal gradient solvers are also known as ISTA and FISTA.
